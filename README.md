Ugly for now, improvements to come 

qrz account credentials need to be in a file named config.json file like so:
```
{
   "username": "<callsign>",
   "password": "<password>"
}
```

edit mappit.py with your callsign list and run it to generate an html map
open the map in your web browser and enjoy
