# mappit
Functions for mapping amateur radio contacts.

Ugly for now, improvements to come 

qrz account credentials need to be in a config.json file like so:

config.json file contents:
{
  "username": "<callsign>",
  "password": "<password>"
}

edit mappit.py with your callsign list and run it to generate an html map
open the map in your web browser and enjoy
